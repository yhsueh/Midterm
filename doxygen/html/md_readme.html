<h2>Sprint Planning Google Spreadsheet</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Overview: This program is object detection modoule of the robot that helps to expel stray dogs from the area where children or elders are likely to go such as schools or supermarkets. In developing countries, stray dogs can be dangerous as they can be infected with rabies. To stop them from harming innocent beings, the home-made robot is created to patrol the streets and deter dogs. When the robot observes a dog-like object, it would send messages to residents and students nearby so they can avoid the area. At the same time, the robot would trigger the alarm to deter dogs. The robot is helpful, but it might scare off the vision impaired peoples' guiding dogs when it is doing its work. Therefore, if the robot detects humans and dogs together, then it would do nothing.</p>
<p class="startli">Due to time constraint, the program is not completed except for the object detection module, which is the core feature of this program. The planning and prioritized user stories of this project can be viewed from google spreadsheet attached above. The spreadsheet contains product backlog, iterative backlog, and bug log.</p>
<p class="startli">The pipeline of the object detection module is: prepare positive and negative samples, denoise and resizes all the images to 64x64 pixels, extract HOG features from the images, train the classifier with HOG features, detect the object from a random image with the classifier.</p>
<p class="startli">The noise of the images is removed by appling guassian filter. It is simple and effective at reducing guassian noise. The HOG + SVM technique is popular at identifying objects through their shapes and contours. Another popular technique is cascade Harr training, but it is relatively time consuming and is worse than HOG for this application. Nevertheless, Cascade Harr prevails HOG on face recognitions.</p>
<p class="startli">The performance of the object detection module is decent, but there are lots of false postives results. The possible reason is that the positive images used to train the classifier consisted of frontal, real and side view of dogs. The mixture of different views of dogs could affect the performance. A demo is presented in the folder, the instructions of how to the demo is addressed below. The demo shows three successful cases of dog detection.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Two shared libraries are used in this project, OpenCV and Boost filesystem libraries. The program won't run without installing them on the machine. Fortunately, these libraries can be installed easily on Ubuntu. First, to install OpenCV, switch to the project root directory, and type the following command. The bash file is created by milq.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;bash install0opencvInstall.sh</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> by <a href="http://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/">http://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/</a></p>
<p>Second, the boost filesystem library is installed to facilitate files and directories manipulations. It is available in Ubuntu package repository. To install it, type the following commands in command window:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;sudo apt-get update</div><div class="line"><a name="l00002"></a><span class="lineno">    2</span>&#160;sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>## Standard build via command-line </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">    1</span>&#160;git clone --recursive https://github.com/yhsueh/Midterm</div><div class="line"><a name="l00002"></a><span class="lineno">    2</span>&#160;cd &lt;path to repository&gt;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00003"></a><span class="lineno">    3</span>&#160;mkdir build</div><div class="line"><a name="l00004"></a><span class="lineno">    4</span>&#160;cd build</div><div class="line"><a name="l00005"></a><span class="lineno">    5</span>&#160;cmake ..</div><div class="line"><a name="l00006"></a><span class="lineno">    6</span>&#160;make</div><div class="line"><a name="l00007"></a><span class="lineno">    7</span>&#160;Run tests: ./test/cpp-test</div><div class="line"><a name="l00008"></a><span class="lineno">    8</span>&#160;Run program: ./app/shell-app</div></div><!-- fragment --><h2>Run Demo</h2>
<ul>
<li>Demo To run demo, after building the project with cmake and make, run the shell-app executables in app folder under project root directory. In demo mode, the pre-trained SVM would be used to identify objects. To switch to training mode, simply change the mode variable in demo.cpp to 0, and the program will re-train a classifier. Initially, the sample image of a vision impaired person will pop up, and it would be classified as non-dog object, return 01. Subsequently, three street views are being tested with SVM, and the results would be printed in the terminal.</li>
</ul>
